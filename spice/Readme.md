## How to obtain the NEO binary Kernels of all NEOS

ObtenIDs.py will download all the SPK Kernels from the NEOs SPKIDs in NEO_results.csv (from small bodies DB) in ./kernels/neos 
(YOU SHOULD CREATE THE FOLDER!, we deleted it and the current content as it did not make sense to upload the current 14K Binary SPKs).

The ObtenIDs.py program uses indeed a modified Bash JPL spcript to download from Horizons the SPKs. We needed to modify it as 
when the original tries to download a big SPK it does not go into passive mode (there was a small bug there that could be related
with the software version). 


## How to populate the database after running ObtenIDs.py

populatedatabase.py will populate the mongodb database (you should create the database yourself and change the 'user','url' and 'password' properly)

## How to allow NEOFIT to update its dabases on a frequent basis:

Both python programs (ObtenIDs.py and populatedatabase.py) should be included in the Crontab of your system.

## Rest API

Rest api will provide with a REST API that will interact with BOKEH and SPICE.
Don't forget to keep running restapi.py in order to provide the web system with the JPL SPICE NEO results.

## NEOs SPKID

As for now if you want to have all new NEO you should download from the JPL Small Bodies database a CSV with the SPKID in the first column and overwrite the current file. 
You may want to put that into a script and added it to the crontab.
